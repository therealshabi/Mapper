# Mapper

Mapper is a Flag Quiz which is an Educational App for Kids, where they can improve their knowledge of Different country's flag plus they also have additional important General Information about the countries.

Coming to the tehnical part this application uses Android in which I've used Soundex Phonetic Algorithm plus Hashmaps 
for making the data searching more efficient.
